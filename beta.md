# About the Beta Model

The Beta model thus far consists of a small database of projects, a Python Script scraper and script to run an interface on a local network.

## The Database

To create the database, I created a csv file and populated it with projects that I know from my own experience to be good starter projects and projects that I found by searching existing DIY project sites.

I scrap this database using pandas.

## Interface

The interface is a html-only website that is posted onto the local network using web.py
