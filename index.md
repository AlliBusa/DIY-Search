# Why Do We Need Another DIY Website?

On the internet, one can find websites like makezine.com or instructables.com that have a plethora of DIY projects to do. To search for projects on these websites, we search by project name - what do we do when we have a limited number of materials and no idea about what we can make with them?  

When I started doing DIY projects, I relied primarily on these sites to find projects to do. In those days, finding a good project seemed like a lot of work. I would find a project that excited me, only to realize that I needed some material or tool that I couldn't get. I wanted to make a tool that beginner DIYers like myself could use so that we can go straight to DIYing, instead of being perpetually demoralized about what we can't use and what we don't have.
